### About the Author

**[R. Fisher / Braid Dynamics]**
*Principal Investigator*

The Quantum Braid Dynamics framework was developed to explore the intersection of graph theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and quantum foundations. This monograph is the result of an independent research initiative aimed at establishing a rigorous, background-independent ontology for physics.

The text, diagrams, and intellectual property contained within the *Quantum Braid Dynamics* monograph are the exclusive property of the author. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution without attribution is prohibited.

### Disclaimer
This monograph proposes a novel theoretical framework for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is presented as a formal hypothesis subject to peer review, experimental verification, and the falsifiability criteria of the scientific method.
