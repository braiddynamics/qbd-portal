### About the Author

R. Fisher, *Principal Investigator* @Braid Dynamics**

ORCID: 0009-0006-2441-3282

The Quantum Braid Dynamics framework was developed to explore the intersection of graph theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and quantum foundations. This monograph is the result of an independent research initiative aimed at establishing a rigorous, background-independent ontology for physics.

### Disclaimer
This monograph proposes a novel theoretical framework for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. It is presented as a formal hypothesis subject to peer review, experimental verification, and the falsifiability criteria of the scientific method.
