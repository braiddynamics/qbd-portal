## 8.3 The Chiral Weak Interaction {#8.3}

:::note[**Section 8.3 Overview**]
:::

The maximal violation of parity by the weak interaction, which acts exclusively on left-handed particles, represents a profound asymmetry that defies the intuitive expectation of mirror invariance in natural laws. We face the paradox of deriving a chiral force from a vacuum constructed on neutral, symmetric principles, requiring a mechanism where the arrow of time itself imposes a handedness on interaction vertices. This investigation seeks to replace the phenomenological insertion of chiral projectors with a derivation that links the V-A coupling structure to the irreversibility of causal sequences.

Theoretical frameworks typically enforce parity violation by constructing chiral Lagrangians where left and right-handed fields transform under different representations, a mathematical solution that lacks a physical rationale for nature's abhorrence of the mirror image. In a discrete causal model, one might expect all interactions to be reversible and symmetric; a failure to break this symmetry spontaneously would render the model incompatible with the observed universe. The persistence of the "mirror universe" problem in standard unification theories suggests that chirality is not an accident of symmetry breaking but a fundamental feature of the spacetime metric. Explaining this requires a mechanism that physically forbids the existence of right-handed currents, treating them not as heavy or suppressed states, but as topological impossibilities within the causal flow.

We establish the chiral nature of the weak force by linking the timestamp ordering of causal paths to the topological handedness of braid crossings. We demonstrate that the "right-handed" mirror process requires a timestamp inversion that generates forbidden causal loops, leading to the annihilation of right-handed currents via the Principle of Unique Causality and enforcing the observed chiral projection as a consistency condition of the timeline.

### 8.3.1 Definition: The Chiral Invariant {#8.3.1}

:::tip[**Quantification of Handedness through Effective History Monotonicity**]
:::

The **Chiral Invariant**, denoted $\chi$, is defined strictly as a topological quantum number quantifying the causal orientation of a flavor-changing rewrite process $\mathcal{R}_W$ within the causal graph $G_t$. This invariant is computed as the signum of the timestamp difference between the constituent edges of the active 2-path precursor, satisfying the relation $\chi = \operatorname{sgn}(H_t(e_1) - H_t(e_2))$, subject to the following structural constraints:
1.  **Path Ordering:** The edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are ordered sequentially along the directed causal path from the initial ribbon state to the final state.
2.  **Monotonicity Enforcement:** The value of $\chi$ is fixed by the strict monotonicity of the History Function $H_t$ [(§1.3.4)](/monograph/rules/ontology/1.3/#1.3.4), where the forward causal order $H_t(e_1) < H_t(e_2)$ yields the left-handed value $\chi = -1$, and the reverse order yields the right-handed value $\chi = +1$.
3.  **Projective Action:** The invariant functions as a selection operator within the Universal Constructor [(§4.5.1)](/monograph/rules/dynamics/4.5/#4.5.1), gating the acceptance probability $P_{\text{acc}}$ via the chiral projector $P_\chi = \frac{1}{2}(I + \chi \gamma_5)$.

### 8.3.1.2 Commentary: Chiral Arrow {#8.3.1.2}

:::info[**Definition of Handedness through Temporal Directionality**]
:::

The **chiral invariant definition** [(§8.3.1)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.1) connects the direction of time to the handedness of particles. In a static knot, left and right are arbitrary conventions; one could flip the image and the physics would look the same. However, in a causal graph, the flow of timestamps provides an absolute reference frame that breaks this symmetry. This inherent directionality resonates with **[(Lamport, 1978)](/monograph/appendices/a-references#A.39)** theory of logical clocks, where the ordering of events is primary. In QBD, this ordering doesn't just sequence events; it determines the geometric orientation of interactions, distinguishing "forward" twists from "backward" ones.

Defining chirality based on the timestamp difference of the crossing strands links geometry to causality. A left-handed crossing is defined as one where the over-crossing strand is causally earlier than the under-crossing one. This is a structural property, not just a label. This definition allows the physics to distinguish between a process and its mirror image, providing the necessary hook for Parity Violation. The universe is not mirror-symmetric because the arrow of time breaks the symmetry between forward and backward crossing orders. The geometry of the weak force is literally shaped by the flow of time.

### 8.3.2 Theorem: Chiral Symmetry and Parity Violation {#8.3.2}

:::info[**Emergence of Weak Gauge Theory from Doublet Flavor Rewrites**]
:::

The Weak Interaction constitutes a chiral gauge theory governing the transformation of electroweak doublets, characterized by the strict enforcement of left-handed currents and the violation of parity symmetry. This emergence is established by the following topological selection rules:
1.  **Chiral Projection:** The flavor-changing rewrites acting on the doublet space are restricted to the $\chi = -1$ sector by the strict monotonicity of the timestamp ordering, which aligns the causal flow with the left-handed projector $P_L$.
2.  **Mirror Exclusion:** The right-handed mirror processes, characterized by $\chi = +1$, are physically excluded from the dynamics by the Principle of Unique Causality [(§2.3.3)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.3/#2.3.3), which identifies the inverted timestamp order as a generator of redundant causal paths.
3.  **Gauge Structure:** The resulting interaction algebra generates the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry group, with the V-A current structure arising directly from the topological filtration of the causal graph.

### 8.3.2.1 Argument Outline: Logic of Weak Interaction {#8.3.2.1}

:::tip[**Logical Structure of the Proof via Chiral Filtering**]
:::

The derivation of the Chiral Weak Interaction proceeds through a synthesis of topological constraints and causal ordering. This approach validates that the V-A structure is an emergent consequence of timestamp monotonicity, independent of parity violation postulates.

First, we isolate the **Doublet Formation** by pairing lepton braids with complementary writhe. We demonstrate that the conservation of total charge enforces the pairing, allowing the rewrite to mix the states via rung swaps while preserving the total writhe.

Second, we model the **Chiral Projection** by analyzing the timestamp ordering on rewrite paths. We argue that the strict monotonicity of timestamps enforces a specific chiral invariant for forward causal mixes, biasing the system toward left-handed configurations. We show that the projection operator emerges from the anticommutation of the chiral stabilizer with the Dirac slash.

Third, we derive the **PUC Enforcement** by examining the redundancy of right-handed paths. We show that inverting the timestamp order creates alternative mediated paths that violate the Principle of Unique Causality. We quantify the rejection probability for these mirror processes, demonstrating that it approaches unity.

Finally, we synthesize these components to prove **SU(2)_L Emergence**. We show that the mixing generates the algebra from Pauli-like operators acting on the doublet, with the left-projector emergent from the chiral gating. We derive the full V-A form of the electroweak current from the path integral over causal trajectories.

### 8.3.3 Lemma: Chiral Stability {#8.3.3}

:::info[**Verification of Invariant Persistence under Local Transformations**]
:::

The value of the chiral invariant $\chi(\mathcal{R}_W)$ is stable against all local graph transformations that preserve the causal order. This stability is enforced by the following invariants:
1.  **Functorial Preservation:** The evolution of the graph constitutes a functor in the History Category $\mathbf{Hist}$ [(§4.1.3)](/monograph/rules/dynamics/4.1/#4.1.3), which preserves the partial ordering of edges $e_a \le e_b$ under all valid morphisms.
2.  **Sign Invariance:** Consequently, while local deformations may rescale the magnitude of the timestamp difference $\Delta H$, the signum $\operatorname{sgn}(\Delta H)$ remains invariant, locking the chirality of the process.
3.  **Topological Locking:** The effective influence relation $\le$ ensures that the minimal mediated path remains the geodesic, preventing the spontaneous inversion of handedness without a violation of Acyclicity [(§2.7.1)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.7/#2.7.1).

### 8.3.3.1 Proof: Invariance Verification {#8.3.3.1}

:::tip[**Demonstration of Sign Preservation via Causal Functoriality**]
:::

**I. Invariant Definition via Timestamps**
The timestamp map $H_t: E \to \mathbb{N}$ assigns strictly increasing values along directed paths, enforcing causal precedence. For a flavor-changing process $\mathcal{R}_W$, the active 2-path involves edges $e_1, e_2$ such that $v_{in} \xrightarrow{e_1} v_{mid} \xrightarrow{e_2} v_{out}$. By **Acyclicity** [(§2.7.1)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.7/#2.7.1), strict ordering holds: $H_t(e_1) < H_t(e_2)$.
The chiral sign is defined as $\chi = \operatorname{sgn}(H_t(e_1) - H_t(e_2))$.
Since $H_t$ is strictly monotonic, $\Delta H = H_t(e_1) - H_t(e_2)$ is always negative for the forward path.
$$\chi(\mathcal{R}_W) = -1$$
This defines the Left-Handed Chirality intrinsic to the forward causal evolution.

**II. Stability Under Local Transformations**
Consider a local transformation $T: G \to G'$ (e.g., a planar isotopy or a disjoint rewrite).
1.  **Functoriality:** The evolution defines a functor in the **History Category** $\mathbf{Hist}$ [(§4.1.3)](/monograph/rules/dynamics/4.1/#4.1.3). Morphisms $f: G \to G'$ map edges $e$ to $f(e)$ while preserving the partial order: $e_a \le e_b \implies f(e_a) \le f(e_b)$.
2.  **Order Preservation:** Consequently, $H_t'(f(e_1)) < H_t'(f(e_2))$. The magnitude of the timestamp difference scales uniformly as $\Delta H' = \alpha \Delta H$ with $\alpha > 0$, but the sign is invariant.
    $$\operatorname{sgn}(H_t'(f(e_1)) - H_t'(f(e_2))) = \operatorname{sgn}(\alpha \Delta H) = -1$$
3.  **Topological Locking:** Under Reidemeister moves, the framing of the ribbon aligns with the causal orientation. The moves preserve the oriented path lengths relative to the causal foliation, keeping the sign fixed as a framed link invariant. The **Effective Influence** relation $\le$ [(§2.6.1)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.6/#2.6.1) ensures that the minimal mediated path remains the geodesic.

**III. Uniqueness of the 2-Path Motif**
The uniqueness of the edge pair $(e_1, e_2)$ is guaranteed by the **Principle of Unique Causality (PUC)**. Any alternative pair $(e_1', e_2')$ connecting the same endpoints would constitute a redundant causal pathway.
If an alternative existed with reversed timestamps (implying $\chi=+1$), it would form a closed causal loop or a violation of strict monotonicity.
Therefore, the sign $\chi = -1$ is a unique topological invariant of the valid flavor-changing rewrite.

Q.E.D.

### 8.3.3.2 Commentary: Handedness Persistence {#8.3.3.2}

:::info[**Topological Protection of Chiral Invariants against Local Perturbations**]
:::

The verification of chiral stability [(§8.3.3)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.3) demonstrates that the chiral sign is robust against local perturbations. One might worry that a random fluctuation could flip the timestamp order, converting a left-handed particle into a right-handed one, effectively washing out the weak interaction. The proof shows this is topologically forbidden.

The effective influence relation imposes a strict partial order on the graph. For a valid crossing to exist, the path from the "over" strand to the "under" strand must respect this order. Reversing the timestamps would require reversing the causal path, which violates the acyclicity of the graph, creating a grandfather paradox. Furthermore, isotopies of the braid preserve the relative ordering of the endpoints. Therefore, chirality behaves as a conserved topological quantum number. Once a particle is created with a specific handedness, the causal structure of spacetime locks that orientation in place. The weak force is chiral because causality itself is chiral.

### 8.3.4 Lemma: Weak Algebra Emergence {#8.3.4}

:::info[**Isomorphism between Doublet Flavor Rewrites and the Special Unitary Group**]
:::

The Lie algebra generated by the set of flavor-changing rewrite processes $\{\mathcal{R}_W\}$ acting upon the electroweak doublet subspace is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. This isomorphism is established by the closure of the commutator algebra formed by the fundamental swap operator and the diagonal writhe-measurement operator, satisfying the structure constants $\epsilon_{ijk}$ of the weak isospin group.

### 8.3.4.1 Proof: Doublet Algebra Verification {#8.3.4.1}

:::tip[**Explicit Construction of Pauli Matrices from Flavor-Changing Operators**]
:::

The proof identifies the flavor-changing rewrite rule $\mathcal{R}_W$ as the generator of transformations between braid states in the electroweak doublet and demonstrates that its dynamics produce the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebra basis.

**I. Identification of $\mathcal{R}_W$ and Doublet Embedding**
The weak interaction transforms an electron braid state into a neutrino braid state ($e^- \to \nu_e$).
In the QBD framework, this is realized by the rewrite process $\mathcal{R}_W$ acting on the tripartite doublet configurations within the 3-ribbon manifold.
The doublet subspace is spanned by the writhe-neutral basis states:
* $|\nu_e\rangle$: Writhe vector $\vec{w}=(0,0,0)$, Stabilizer $\lambda=(1,1,1)$.
* $|e^-\rangle$: Writhe vector $\vec{w}=(-1,-1,-1)$, Stabilizer $\lambda=(-1,-1,-1)$.
$\mathcal{R}_W$ operates on this two-dimensional subspace by swapping or mixing the basis states via local rung modifications on the shared 3-cycle bridge [(§6.2.1)](tripartite-braid#6.2.1). The preservation of triality follows from the modulo-3 invariance of the braid word, as the third ribbon's linking $L_{13}, L_{23}$ remains unchanged, ensuring the representation decomposes into the $2+1$ irreps of $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L$.

**II. Application of the Generator Principle**
Following the **Generator Principle** [(§8.1.1)](/monograph/players/braids/8.1/#8.1.1), the unitary operator $\mathcal{R}_W$ is generated by a Hermitian Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_W$ via $\mathcal{R}_W = e^{i\hat{H}_W t}$.
For the doublet transition $|\nu_e\rangle \leftrightarrow |e^-\rangle$, the simplest traceless Hermitian operator is the off-diagonal Pauli matrix $\sigma_x$:
$$\hat{H}_W \propto \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
The proportionality constant is $1/\sqrt{2}$, derived from the trace normalization $\operatorname{Tr}(\hat{H}_W^2) = 2$ required for the Killing metric. The tracelessness ensures compatibility with the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ adjoint representation. The Pauli form arises from the two-state swap as the generator of $SO(2)$ rotations in the doublet.

**III. Generating the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Basis**
The algebra is generated by commutators of $\hat{H}_W$ and the diagonal operators associated with writhe measurement.
1.  **Generator 1:** $\hat{H}_x = \hat{H}_W \propto \sigma_x$.
2.  **Generator 2:** Let $\hat{H}_z$ be the operator measuring the writhe difference (Hypercharge/Isospin projection). In the doublet basis, this arises from the **Spin Stabilizer** $L_S$ [(§7.1.1)](quantum-numbers#7.1.1):
    $$\hat{H}_z \propto \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$
    where the eigenvalues $\pm 1$ correspond to the stabilizer values for the two states.
3.  **Generator 3:** The commutator generates the third basis element:
    $$[\hat{H}_x, \hat{H}_z] \propto [\sigma_x, \sigma_z] = -2i \sigma_y$$
    Let $\hat{H}_y \propto \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. This corresponds to the imaginary phase shifts induced by the rung twist operator $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$.

**IV. Closure and Uniqueness**
The set $\{\hat{H}_x, \hat{H}_y, \hat{H}_z\}$ satisfies the standard $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ commutation relations:
$$[\hat{H}_i, \hat{H}_j] = 2i \epsilon_{ijk} \hat{H}_k$$
This closes the algebra. The process generates exactly three linearly independent traceless Hermitian matrices.
The subspace dimension ($d=2$) limits the algebra strictly to $\mathfrak{su}(2)$; higher algebras would require $d > 2$. The negative-definite Killing form $K = -2 \operatorname{Tr}(\text{ad}^2)$ confirms the algebra is semi-simple and isomorphic to the weak isospin algebra.

Q.E.D.

### 8.3.4.2 Commentary: Weak Force Algebra {#8.3.4.2}

:::info[**Generation of Weak Isospin via Doublet Transformations**]
:::

The emergence of SU(2) [(§8.3.4)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.4) parallels the $SU(3)$ derivation but applies it to the electroweak doublet. The rewrite process, which swaps the neutrino and electron braid topologies, acts as the generator of the weak force.

The algebraic proof confirms that this single swapping operation, combined with phase rotations allowed by the code space, generates the full $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. This corresponds to the $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z^0$ bosons before mixing. The crucial insight here is that the Weak Force is literally the mechanism that transforms one lepton topology into another, the operator of transmutation. The isomorphism to $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ ensures these transmutations obey the strict group-theoretical rules required by the Standard Model. It means that the weak force is not an external field acting on particles, but the operation of the particles transforming into each other.

### 8.3.5 Lemma: Right-Handed Rejection {#8.3.5}

:::info[**Calculation of Near-Unity Suppression for Mirror Processes**]
:::

The probability of realizing a right-handed mirror process within the causal graph is suppressed to a value approaching zero. This rejection is quantified by the following statistical bounds:
1.  **Path Redundancy:** The inversion of timestamps required for a right-handed crossing creates a high probability of generating redundant paths of length $\le 2$ within the local neighborhood, scaling with the edge density $\rho_e$.
2.  **Detection Fidelity:** The local stabilizer checks within the quasi-local radius $R \sim \log N$ detect these redundancies with a fidelity of $1 - e^{-R}$, ensuring that violations of the Principle of Unique Causality are identified and annihilated.
3.  **Projective Collapse:** Consequently, the effective rejection rate for the mirror process satisfies $P(\text{reject}) \approx 1$, rendering the right-handed interaction physically impossible in the thermodynamic limit.

### 8.3.5.1 Proof: Rejection Logic {#8.3.5.1}

:::tip[**Derivation of Rejection Rates from Path Redundancy and Local Checks**]
:::

**I. Statistical Failure Probability**
The probability of **PUC** failure for an inverted (right-handed) path scales with the expected number of alternative short paths in the sparse graph.
Using a Poisson model for alternatives in an Erdos-Renyi graph with edge probability $\rho_e = \langle k \rangle / N \approx 0.029$:
The probability of no alternative short path is $P(\text{unique}) = \exp(-\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the expected number of alternatives.
For a local distance $\bar{d}=2$, amplified by the 3-path span in the braid support:
$$\lambda \approx \langle k \rangle^2 \rho_3^* \approx 9 \times 0.029 \approx 0.26$$
This yields a mean-field rejection probability $P(\text{alt}) = 1 - e^{-0.26} \approx 0.23$.

**II. Local Detection Fidelity**
The violation is detected by the local stabilizer checks within the **Quasi-Local Radius** $R \sim \log N$.
The **BFS Search** scans for alternatives with a failure rate (false negative) scaling as $e^{-R}$.
With $R = \log_{\text{diam}} N \approx \log_3 10^6 \approx 9.5$:
$$\text{Fidelity} = 1 - e^{-R} \approx 1 - 10^{-4.5} \approx 0.99997$$

**III. Combined Rejection Rate**
The total rejection rate for the forbidden right-handed process combines the existence of alternatives with the detection fidelity.
The probability that an alternative exists ($\ge 1$) scales as $P(\text{alt} \ge 1) = 1 - e^{-0.087} \approx 0.083$ (base), scaled to $\approx 0.2$ by the local triplet density.
$$P(\text{reject}) \approx 1 - (1 - P(\text{alt})) \times e^{-R}$$
Since $P(\text{alt})$ is significant ($\sim 0.2$) and detection is nearly perfect, the system rejects the process whenever an alternative exists.
In the strict limit of the **Code Space** $\mathcal{C}$, the projector $\Pi_{PUC}$ annihilates any state with path redundancy.
Thus, the effective rejection rate for the mirror process approaches unity ($1 - 10^{-3}$) in the physical regime.

Q.E.D.

### 8.3.5.2 Commentary: Parity Violation Mechanism {#8.3.5.2}

:::info[**Rejection of Mirror Configurations due to Causal Loop Formation**]
:::

This result derives parity violation, the fact that the weak force only acts on left-handed particles, rather than inserting it by hand. This has been a mystery in physics since the Wu experiment.

The determination of the right-handed rejection rate [(§8.3.5)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.5) proves that the Right-Handed version of the weak interaction is physically impossible in the graph. Constructing the mirror-image crossing requires inverting the timestamp order, effectively demanding a backward time step locally. This creates a conflict with the global causal order, manifesting as a violation of the Principle of Unique Causality (PUC). The graph rejects the right-handed process with probability approaching unity because it cannot accommodate the necessary causal loops without breaking the code. The universe is Left-Handed because Right-Handed physics is computationally illegal. Parity violation is the shadow cast by the arrow of time.

### 8.3.6 Lemma: Topological Parity Violation {#8.3.6}

:::info[**Mechanistic Origin of Asymmetry due to Causal Locking**]
:::

The parity symmetry of the weak interaction is strictly violated by the topological constraints of the causal graph. This violation is enforced by the **Chiral Lock** mechanism, wherein the right-handed mirror configuration of a flavor-changing process is rendered physically impossible by the Principle of Unique Causality, restricting all valid weak currents to the left-handed chiral sector defined by the projector $P_L = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \gamma_5)$.

### 8.3.6.1 Proof: Parity Asymmetry Verification {#8.3.6.1}

:::tip[**Demonstration of the Exclusion of Right-Handed Currents by Axiomatic Constraints**]
:::

The proof synthesizes the chiral invariant and PUC violation to demonstrate that parity asymmetry is an inevitable mechanistic consequence of the causal graph structure.

**I. Chiral Bias from Causality**
The chiral invariant $\chi$ [(§8.3.3)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.3) embeds a left-handed preference via the timestamp ordering $H_t$.
The strict monotonicity condition $H_t(e_{in}) < H_t(e_{out})$ aligns the braid overcrossing with the forward causal arrow.
Explicitly, the overcrossing edge $e_{over}$ carries a higher timestamp $H_t(e_{over}) > H_t(e_{under})$.
This enforces the left-handed twist via the sign convention in the half-twist operator $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$, which maps to the chiral projector $\frac{1-\gamma_5}{2}$ in the emergent Dirac algebra.

**II. Mirror Exclusion via PUC**
The right-handed mirror process requires inverting the timestamp order to $H_t(e_{out}) < H_t(e_{in})$.
This inversion exposes pre-existing mediated paths as valid alternatives under the **Effective Influence** relation $\le$ [(§2.6.1)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.6/#2.6.1).
The cardinality of the path set for the inverted case becomes $|\Pi(u,v)| > 1$ with high probability (proven in **8.3.5.1**).
The existence of multiple paths violates the **Principle of Unique Causality (PUC)** [(§2.3.3)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.3/#2.3.3).
Consequently, the local projector $\Pi_{local}$ [(§3.5.4.1)](/monograph/rules/architecture/3.5/#3.5.4.1) assigns a zero eigenvalue (annihilation) to the right-handed transition amplitude.

**III. Conclusion: V-A Structure**
Weak currents are strictly left-handed because right-handed currents are axiomatically invalid state transitions.
The asymmetry matches the observed $V-A$ structure:
$$J^\mu \propto \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma_5) \psi$$
The coefficient is 1 for left-handed states (valid paths) and 0 for right-handed states (forbidden paths). This maximal violation follows from the binary nature of the chiral stabilizer $S_\chi$, which projects strictly to the $\chi=-1$ eigenspace without intermediate values.

Q.E.D.

### 8.3.6.2 Commentary: Chiral Lock {#8.3.6.2}

:::info[**Enforcement of Vector-Axial Currents via Topological Filtering**]
:::

The Chiral Lock theorem synthesizes the findings of this section, establishing that the restriction to Left-Handed currents (Vector minus Axial, or V-A) is not a preference but a structural constraint of the causal graph. The graph acts as a topological filter, permitting the Left-Handed topology because it aligns with the monotonic flow of timestamps. Conversely, it blocks the Right-Handed topology because the requisite timestamp inversion clashes with the arrow of time, generating redundant paths that violate the Principle of Unique Causality.

This filtering mechanism results in the specific form of the weak current $J^\mu = \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu (1 - \gamma^5) \psi$. The factor $(1-\gamma^5)$ serves as the algebraic signature of this topological filter, projecting out the right-handed components. This derivation grounds one of the most puzzling features of particle physics, the maximization of parity violation, in the fundamental nature of causal time. The universe exhibits left-handedness not by accident, but because the alternative violates the axioms of sequence.

### 8.3.7 Lemma: Mirror PUC Violation {#8.3.7}

:::info[**Violation of the Principle of Unique Causality by Right-Handed Configurations**]
:::

The configuration corresponding to a right-handed flavor-changing process constitutes a direct violation of the Principle of Unique Causality. This violation is established by the following structural contradictions:
1.  **Timestamp Inversion:** The right-handed process requires the condition $H_t(e_{out}) < H_t(e_{in})$, which contradicts the forward flow of the background causal metric.
2.  **Parallel Path Formation:** This inversion generates a local backward path that runs parallel to existing forward mediated routes, increasing the cardinality of the path set $|\Pi(u,v)|$ to a value strictly greater than 1.
3.  **Axiomatic Invalidity:** The existence of multiple paths between the interaction vertices violates the uniqueness constraint, triggering the annihilation of the state vector by the local projector $\Pi_{local}$.

### 8.3.7.1 Proof: PUC Violation Logic {#8.3.7.1}

:::tip[**Formal Demonstration of Redundant Path Formation in Mirror Processes**]
:::

**I. Path Uniqueness Condition**
The **Principle of Unique Causality (PUC)** [(§2.3.3)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.3/#2.3.3) mandates that for any causal rewrite proposal $u \to v$, the set of existing paths of length $\le 2$ must be empty (for new edges) or a singleton (for modifications).
$$\text{PUC Constraint: } |\Pi_{\le 2}(u, v)| \in \{0, 1\}$$

**II. Left-Handed Validity**
For the standard (left-handed) $\mathcal{R}_W$, the timestamp ordering $H_t(e_1) < H_t(e_2)$ ensures the new path is chronologically distinct from any background paths. The "earlier-over-later" geometry prevents the formation of shortcuts or closed loops.
$$|\Pi_{L}(u, v)| = 1$$

**III. Right-Handed Violation**
The mirror (right-handed) process reverses the local order: $H_t(e_2) < H_t(e_1)$.
However, the graph's global causality preserves the original background paths.
This reversal creates a "backward" local path that runs parallel to existing forward mediated routes in the background graph.
Specifically, if a path $E \to C \to D$ exists with $H_t(E) < H_t(C) < H_t(D)$, the inverted rewrite attempts to establish a link that effectively bypasses $C$ with a timestamp violating the established lightcone.
This results in $|\Pi_{R}(u, v)| > 1$.

**IV. Quantification**
The expected number of residual paths scales as the out-degree $\langle k \rangle$ in the causal tree.
The violation probability is governed by the correlation length $\xi \sim 1/\rho_e$ [(§5.5.5)](/monograph/rules/thermodynamics/5.5/#5.5.5):
$$P(\text{violation}) = 1 - e^{-\xi^2 \rho_e} \approx 0.2$$
Amplified by the BFS search fidelity ($1 - e^{-R}$), the rejection rate is:
$$P(\text{reject}) \approx 1 - (1 - P(\text{alt})) e^{-R} \approx 0.9992$$
This confirms the near-unity suppression of the right-handed process.

### 8.3.7.2 Commentary: Mirror Failure {#8.3.7.2}

:::info[**Analysis of Right-Handed Interaction Failure via Path Redundancy**]
:::

This commentary expands on the Mirror PUC Violation to clarify exactly why the mirror process fails. It is not merely "disfavored" thermodynamically; it generates a specific graph pathology that the system actively rejects.

When the rewrite rule attempts to construct the Right-Handed crossing, it must connect vertices in a specific order that implies information traveled "instantaneously" or "backwards" relative to the background metric established by the timestamps. This creates a "short-circuit", a redundant path of length $\le 2$ connecting vertices that already possess a valid causal link. The Principle of Unique Causality ($PUC$) functions as the system's immune response to such redundancies. It flags the mirror process as a "cloning error", a duplication of causal history, and suppresses it with probability approaching unity. The apparent "failure" of the right-handed force is, in reality, the successful operation of the vacuum's consistency checks.

### 8.3.8 Proof: The Chiral Weak Interaction Structure {#8.3.8}

:::tip[**Formal Derivation of the Complete Lie Algebra from Discrete Braid Generators**]
:::

The proof integrates the lemmas on doublet algebra, chiral invariance, and parity violation to construct the full electroweak structure, verifying the V-A coupling form.

**I. Doublet Representation Embedding**
The electroweak doublet $(\nu_e, e^-)_L$ is embedded in the tripartite braid as the subspace of **Writhe-Neutral** states [(§7.3.5)](quantum-numbers#7.3.5).
Basis: $|\nu_e\rangle$ ($w=0, \lambda=(1,1,1)$) and $|e^-\rangle$ ($w=-3, \lambda=(-1,-1,-1)$).
These states are mixed by $\mathcal{R}_W$ via rung shuffles on the shared 3-cycle [(§8.3.4)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.4).
The operator $\mathcal{R}_W$ acts as $\sigma_x$, flipping between the states while conserving Total Charge $Q = w/3$ [(§7.3.1)](quantum-numbers#7.3.1) modulo the weak mixing angle.
The writhe-neutral span is the kernel of the total writhe operator $\sum w_i$, projecting out charged excitations.

**II. Chiral Invariant Enforcement**
For every valid $\mathcal{R}_W$, the path edges $e_1, e_2$ satisfy $H_t(e_1) < H_t(e_2)$ by **Monotonic History** [(§1.3.4)](/monograph/rules/ontology/1.3/#1.3.4).
This imposes the chiral sign $\chi = -1$ [(§8.3.3)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.3).
The acceptance weight for the rewrite is biased by $e^{\chi \mu \cdot \text{stress}}$ [(§4.5.2)](/monograph/rules/dynamics/4.5/#4.5.2).
Since $\chi = -1$, the free energy barrier is reduced, favoring left-handed proposals.
The exponential form derives from the Arrhenius factor $e^{\Delta S / T}$ with $\Delta S = \chi \ln 2$ for the syndrome bifurcation.

**III. Parity Violation Mechanism**
The mirror process requires $H_t(e_2) < H_t(e_1)$, contradicting global **Acyclicity**.
This inversion creates a redundant alternative path, violating $|\Pi(u,v)|=1$ [(§2.3.3)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.3/#2.3.3).
The violation triggers a syndrome $\sigma = -1$ in the local stabilizer $S_{uv}$.
The **Correction Map** $C$ projects this state out with probability $\approx 1$ [(§8.3.7)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.7).
The projection is exact because the eigenvalue $\lambda = -1$ falls outside the physical code space.
For global inversions, the **O(N) Barrier** from AEC [(§2.7.2)](/monograph/rules/axioms/2.7/#2.7.2) renders the flip infeasible within a single tick.

**IV. SU(2)_L Closure and Current Form**
The generators $\hat{H}_{x,y,z} \propto \sigma_{x,y,z}$ [(§8.3.4)](/monograph/players/braids/8.3/#8.3.4) act exclusively within the $\chi = -1$ subspace.
This effectively projects the algebra onto the left-handed sector:
$$\mathcal{A}_{weak} = P_L \cdot \mathfrak{su}(2) \cdot P_L, \quad \text{where } P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma_5}{2}$$
The resulting currents take the form $J^\mu_a = \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu P_L \tau^a \psi$.
This matches the phenomenological Lagrangian of the Weak Interaction.
The **Ward Identity** $\partial_\mu J^\mu_a = 0$ is preserved by the rewrite invariance under gauge transformations generated by the closed algebra, as the comonad $R_T$ ensures syndrome-neutrality for adjoint actions.

Q.E.D.

### 8.3.Z Implications and Synthesis {#8.3.Z}

:::note[**The Chiral Weak Interaction**]
:::

The chiral nature of the weak interaction is derived as a topological filter imposed by the arrow of time. We have demonstrated that the "mirror" process of a right-handed interaction requires an inversion of timestamp ordering that violates the Principle of Unique Causality, generating forbidden closed causal loops. The causal graph acts as a diode, permitting only left-handed topological transformations to propagate while suppressing their mirror images with a probability approaching unity.

This transforms parity violation from an unexplained symmetry breaking into a fundamental feature of causal geometry. The universe is not asymmetric by accident; it is asymmetric because the alternative violates the logic of sequence. The V-A structure of the weak current is the algebraic signature of a timeline that flows in only one direction. Matter distinguishes left from right because the vacuum distinguishes past from future.

The suppression of right-handed currents is therefore absolute in the low-energy limit. The weak force does not merely "prefer" left-handed particles; the graph geometry actively annihilates the causal paths required to construct right-handed interactions. The universe is chiral because a non-chiral causal graph would be incapable of sustaining a consistent history.
